 the apparently unstoppable march of israeli settlements into the west bank while peace talks with israel have ceased means that many palestinians have no real hope of an independent or even prosperous future. on the israeli side lt. col. hecht a former battalion commander says ¡°they¡¯re frustrated and disaffiliated and they are saying to all the organized palestinian groups and the pa ¡®we have had enough of you all ¨c we¡¯re sons of the camp.¡¯ they don¡¯t identify with the five-star leadership of the pa in their fancy hotels around the world. they¡¯re now saying we¡¯re fighting for their manhood.¡±
and in the west bank the jenin brigade leader concurs: ¡°all palestinian people ¨c as a result of the [israeli] occupation¡¯s daily violations and invasions and the formation of many extreme right-wing governments [in israel] that weakened the pa and its organizations and leadership ¨c have lost trust in all of the pa organizations.¡±
¡°most of our palestinian youth that fight and are martyred have a university or college degree. he replies: ¡°the occupation killed off all of the peaceful solutions and here on this land there is no place for peaceful solutions with this zionist israeli occupation.¡±
asked if they are of the view that the jewish state should be wiped out he replies: ¡°all armed factions and every militant does not believe in a two-state solution because this occupation did not and will not respect any peaceful agreement.
