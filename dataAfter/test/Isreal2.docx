 hecht admits: ¡°we¡¯re putting a big effort into the connectivity between criminal gangs and terrorism.¡±
it¡¯s been the bloodiest 10 months since 2015 ¨c at least 131 palestinians (not counting gaza) and 21 israelis or foreigners have been killed this year. but there¡¯s been a shift too not just in the level of armed attacks against israeli targets and israel¡¯s campaigns ¨c but a growing resentment towards the leadership of the palestinian authority (pa). indeed the militants of the jenin brigade who sit in the shade of olive trees to hide from israeli surveillance drones had a barely hidden threat to make against the pa.
¡°this is a message to the palestinian leadership: if they believe in the will of the palestinian people they have to join the resistance and give the resistance fighters the freedom to defend and protect our people¡± says the man who leads this delegation of fighters. many other palestinian factions condemn this as ¡°collaboration¡± and according to officials in the israeli military security cooperation has almost broken down in the north of the west bank especially around jenin and nearby nablus.
