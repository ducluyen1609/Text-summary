The head of the perinatal center at a hospital in Kharkiv, Iryna Kondratova, told CNN the risk of a sudden blackout is constantly on her mind. Her hospital has been working hard to secure medical equipment with autonomous power supply because relying on generators is too risky.
¡°It may take approximately 15 to 20 minutes from the moment when the electricity turned off and before it appears from the generator. What shall we do during 15-20 minutes if the child is not breathing?,¡± she explained.
There are other issues she has to think about. The constant Russian attacks on the electricity grid mean supply is unpredictable. ¡°The equipment we work with in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units is affected by even minor voltage fluctuations. The worst thing is when the voltage in the network increases critically, because then the equipment may fail. In case of voltage drops, the equipment may also be turned off,¡± she said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the winter will add ¡°significant challenges¡± to the already difficult life in Ukraine. ¡°Too many people in Ukraine are living precariously, moving from location to location, living in substaAt one disabled coal-fired power plant CNN visited this week, engineers were working around the clock on repairs after Russia attacked the most sensitive part of the facility twice in the past three weeks.
Blown-out windows were being replaced with steel and rubber sheeting. Workers dangled from high voltage cables, reconnecting vital wiring as technicians scoured sifted through burnt out wreckage for serviceable parts.
The engineers work around the clock, but their efforts are constantly interrupted by?air raid sirens. No one knows how long it will take to bring the plant back online, but every minute spent in plant¡¯s bunker is time wasted.
One of the engineers told CNN nothing would stop him and his teams getting the plant up and running again. CNN cannot name him or the power plant for security reasons.
¡°Putin¡¯s game plan is obvious: he wants to make this winter the coldest and darkest in Ukraine¡¯s history,¡± Melinda Haring, the deputy director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council told?CNN. ¡°He will continue to strike infrastructure grids so as to knock out Ukraine¡¯s power and heat. His kamikaze drone attacks are meant to break the will of the Ukrainian people and to spark panic,¡± she added.
