Whether out of choice or a need for political survival, the PA¡¯s ¡°security cooperation¡± with the Israelis in the north of the West Bank has dwindled to almost nothing, an Israeli government official said.
This may be because any attempt to do so risks igniting a civil war between Palestinian militants and the Palestinian Authority.
The apparently unstoppable march of Israeli settlements into the West Bank, while peace talks with Israel have ceased, means that many Palestinians have no real hope of an independent or even prosperous future. This has provoked more violence.
On that, both the IDF spokesman and the fighters in Jenin Camp agree.
On the Israeli side, Lt. Col. Hecht, a former battalion commander says, ¡°They¡¯re frustrated and disaffiliated and they are saying to all the organized Palestinian groups and the PA, ¡®we have had enough of you all ¨C we¡¯re sons of the Camp.¡¯ They don¡¯t identify with the five-star leadership of the PA in their fancy hotels around the world. They¡¯re now saying we¡¯re fighting for their manhood.¡±
And in the West Bank, the Jenin Brigade leader concurs: ¡°All Palestinian people ¨C as a result of the [Israeli] occupation¡¯s daily violations, and invasions, and the formation of many extreme right-wing governments [in Israel] that weakened the PA and its organizations and leadership ¨C have lost trust in all of the PA organizations.¡±
¡°Most of our Palestinian youth that fight and are martyred have a university or college degree. They¡¯ve lost hope of a dignified life,¡± he adds.
But, we asked, given that during the last 20 years, the Israelis have got more settlements, and there has been no progress to independence from the Palestinian perspective, maybe a new path should be found? Isn¡¯t it time to put down your weapons and switch to non-violent protest?
He replies: ¡°The occupation killed off all of the peaceful solutions, and here, on this land, there is no place for peaceful solutions with this Zionist Israeli occupation.¡±
Asked if they are of the view that the Jewish state should be wiped out, he replies: ¡°All armed factions and every militant does not believe in a two-state solution because this occupation did not, and will not, respect any peaceful agreement. I repeat this again, those [Israeli governments] are criminal gangs.¡±
Does this mean that the two sides are stuck in a fatal embrace? ¡°We always aim for victory, and not death. This occupation is sending messages to the international community that we are terrorists. We are not terrorists, we are resistance fighters for freedom,¡± the commander replies.
But he agrees there are more young men flocking to the armed groups and setting up on their own.
