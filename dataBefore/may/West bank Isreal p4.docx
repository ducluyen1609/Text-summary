According to the IDF, ※they think up a target and then go and ask funding from Hamas or Islamic Jihad but they don＊t take orders from anyone.§ Israeli forces are intent on trying to break up these armed groups and reduce the threat to Israel, Hecht says.
※We＊re very focused on precise intelligence: we＊re trying to contain it when we see ticking bombs, the movement of weapons, rhetoric and warnings online 每 then we move to stop it,§ he adds.
On Tuesday, joint Israeli security forces raided Nablus, targeting what they said was the leadership of the Lion＊s Den and an explosives factory. At least five Palestinian men were killed in the raid.
In Jenin, the Palestinian brigade commander talks of plans for operations with militants across the West Bank and abroad that would ※spark a regional war§ that would come out of the camp.
But the more the conflict grows and the bloodier it gets, the greater the chance of the Palestinian Authority being sucked into direct conflict with Israel 每 or that the PA leadership which governs most of the 3.1 million population, dissolves itself. The latter possibility is the outcome Israel most fears.
If the Palestinian leadership in the PA disbanded and returned to full-time resistance across the whole of the West Bank, Israel would have to physically police the whole region 每 and pay for it.
※The PA collapsing or dissolving is the biggest threat. Having us go back into the towns would be a living nightmare,§ says the Israeli government official.
This would turn the clock back to the days before the Oslo peace process. To when Palestinian groups ran a worldwide violent campaign, including terrorist attacks, in the name of freedom. To when Israel was largely isolated internationally 每 and had to use its own money to fund its responsibilities to Palestinians living under its occupation.
That may be exactly what the Jenin Brigade and others may be hoping for.
