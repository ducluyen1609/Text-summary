Some of the M4 weapons cradled by the Palestinian militants have Hebrew etched onto them. ※Senior Israeli commanders steal the weapons and they sell them. We buy them on the black market with money we raise ourselves,§ claims a leader with the Jenin Brigade at our secret meeting in Jenin Refugee Camp.
In 2020 a report by Israel＊s Knesset estimated that 400,000 illegal weapons were circulating in Israel. The IDF admits that weapons have been stolen but denies that ※senior commanders§ are likely to be involved.
Many, the IDF said, are smuggled into the West Bank. Hecht admits: ※We＊re putting a big effort into the connectivity between criminal gangs and terrorism.§
It＊s been the bloodiest 10 months since 2015 每 at least 131 Palestinians (not counting Gaza) and 21 Israelis or foreigners have been killed this year.
But there＊s been a shift, too, not just in the level of armed attacks against Israeli targets and Israel＊s campaigns 每 but a growing resentment towards the leadership of the Palestinian Authority (PA).
Indeed, the militants of the Jenin Brigade who sit in the shade of olive trees to hide from Israeli surveillance drones had a barely hidden threat to make against the PA.
※This is a message to the Palestinian leadership: if they believe in the will of the Palestinian people, they have to join the resistance and give the resistance fighters the freedom to defend and protect our people,§ says the man who leads this delegation of fighters.

Without explicitly threatening the PA leadership, he said that it was hemorrhaging support even among the ranks of its own security forces. Numerous members of the PA＊s police force and other security agencies have been involved in attacking Israeli forces, he said.
Under agreements signed with Israel under the so-called Oslo peace process, the PA is supposed to cooperate on security issues with Israel.
Many other Palestinian factions condemn this as ※collaboration§ and, according to officials in the Israeli military, security cooperation has almost broken down in the north of the West Bank, especially around Jenin and nearby Nablus.
In 1999, members of Fatah, the main group in the Palestine Liberation Movement which still dominates the PA, were beginning to condemn their own leader openly. Back then that was Yasser Arafat 每 who had led the Palestinian cause for years.
Arafat＊s successor at the head of the PA is Mahmoud Abbas, known as Abu Mazen. At 87 his grip has slipped and a growing level of defiance against all that his authority has apparently failed to achieve is driving opposition in the West Bank.
The Jenin Brigade＊s demands of the Palestinian Authority to join a new fight last week prompted PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh to visit Jenin Camp.
He stood next to Fathi Hazem, the father of two sons killed by Israel 每 one who murdered three Israelis in Tel Aviv in a shooting attack at a bar. Both had been members of the Jenin Brigade.
