¡°The time for the Ukrainian counteroffensive is underway now. It has been since August. It continues to be underway now. And it¡¯s likely going to continue and intensify in the winter. I expect that by the time we hit spring, that¡¯s probably when we¡¯re going to see the operational pause. We get the thaw in late February heading into March. That¡¯s when the mud season begins,¡± Barros said.
Another reason for Ukraine to step up its counteroffensive is the state of the Russian military, which has been severely depleted over the past eight months.
¡°The key takeaway is that there are no pristine Russian military units that can fight in Ukraine because they¡¯ve already done so and they¡¯ve all been degraded,¡± Barros said, adding that?Putin¡¯s drive to mobilize?more fighters would not prove that helpful.
¡°Pulling in all these men is not actually going to generate effective combat power, because they¡¯re not receiving adequate training and they¡¯re not receiving adequate supply,¡± Haring said. ¡°There are credible reports of new Russian troops not having food or blankets. Imagine what happens when winter really strikes,¡± she said.
The freezing cold conditions are of course hard on both sides, but experts say the Ukrainians have a psychological advantage: an army of volunteers trying to help where they can, sending warm clothes, supplies, even making equipment.
Vadym Osadchy is one such volunteer. When he and his brothers inherited a small metal working workshop in Kyiv, they didn¡¯t have a clue what to do with it. As the winter approached, they started making small stoves for soldiers at the front lines using their own funds and money and material donated by friends. ¡°We have small volumes, this is not a factory. If we try very hard, we can make 40 to 50 such stoves per month,¡± he said. ¡°Still, these 40-50 stoves mean 500 hundred soldiers staying warm during winter, or maybe even more,¡± he said.
The small makeshift production line is constantly trying to better their product. The latest improvement: adding special fasteners to the stoves so that the soldiers can dry their clothes.
