Jenin Refugee Camp, West BankCNN?¡ª?
Four US-made M4 Carbine rifles lean against the back of the sofa. The young men, mostly dressed in black civilian clothes, are relaxed and chatty. Neighbors pop their heads in to say hello through a door open to the street.
Which is odd.
Because these men are being hunted, targeted for kill-or-capture in a new Israeli military campaign to try to stamp out a fast-growing armed insurrection in the north of the West Bank.
The six men sip tea. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it¡¯s hunting them because they¡¯re members of an armed militant group that¡¯s planning more attacks against Israeli targets.
¡°Martyr posters¡± cover most of the back wall. Young men from the Jenin Brigade, most of them killed in fighting with Israeli troops, smile from their photographs at their living comrades across the room. The men now fiddling with their phones know they themselves may move from the sofa to that wall. An Israeli military strike team could attack at any time.
This is?Jenin Refugee Camp. It¡¯s less than half a kilometer square, home to about 12,500 people and a hotbed of armed resistance against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank ¨C and the existence of the Jewish state itself ¨C for more than 20 years. Its tight alleys and ramshackle homes are densely packed, and crackle with tension.
At midday it¡¯s shuttered while the neighboring town of Jenin is raucous with life. Locals say people mostly sleep during the day because at night there¡¯s often fighting.
Earlier this year, eight Israeli civilians were killed in attacks in Tel Aviv and nearby Bnei B¡¯rak by gunmen from around Jenin. Both of the militants in those incidents were killed.
There has been a surge in armed assaults on Israeli troops and civilians this year. According to the IDF, there have been around 180 shooting incidents in Israel and the occupied territories this year, compared to 61 shooting attacks in 2021.?The Israeli military and police have seized 900 weapons from Palestinians.
Two days after we met, another Palestinian youth, aged 19 and a member of the Jenin Brigade¡¯s militant armed group,?was killed when Israeli forces stormed Jenin in an operation against the militants.
¡°Jenin is the hornets¡¯ nest,¡± says IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht.
