Kyiv, UkraineCNN?¡ª?
As?winter edges ever closer?in Ukraine, Alla Melnychuk and her neighbors are racing against the time to save what little they have left.
Their apartment building in?Irpin?was hit during some of the heaviest?fighting?in March. Most of the windows are still shattered, the roof is gone and the sewer shafts have burned down, meaning there¡¯s no water supply and no sewage outlet. Heavy rains in September caused even more damage, but Melnychuk is determined to push ahead with the repairs. ¡°I still plan to spend the winter in Irpin,¡± she told CNN.
Melnychuk, her husband and their cat Murchyk are now renting a temporary apartment in Kyiv, but they are hoping to return to Irpin, the once quiet, leafy suburb of the capital that became the frontline during Russia¡¯s attempt to take out Ukraine¡¯s leadership in the spring. ¡°We are late, we are slowly rebuilding, we have bought wood and we are installing the roof, but I am not even considering the option that we won¡¯t finish it before winter,¡± she said.
As the weather becomes colder, millions of Ukrainians like Melnychuk are trying to prepare for what they know will be an extremely difficult winter, rushing to repair their homes and secure enough fuel to stay warm. The Ukrainian government said in July that over 800,000 homes had been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war in February, leaving thousands of people without a roof over their head.
Those problems have been compounded in recent weeks by?Russia¡¯s barrage of attacks?on Ukraine¡¯s power and heating infrastructure.
Ukraine¡¯s electricity demand has fallen by about 40% since Russia¡¯s invasion, according to the International Energy Agency, but even so, the government is preparing people for a tough winter ahead.
The Ukrainian energy agency said that it had to implement ¡°severe¡± and ¡°unprecedented¡± emergency power cuts in Kyiv to avoid a ¡°complete blackout¡± as the capital faces a power deficit of 30%. It has urged residents to use electricity ¡°sparingly,¡± especially in the morning and at night, while businesses have been asked to turn off the lights outside offices, restaurants and shopping centers.
The blackouts are unpredictable, which means people must be ready at all times. Computers and phones get charged whenever there¡¯s a chance. Some elevators in the city¡¯s many high-rise residential buildings are equipped with emergency supply boxes containing water, snacks, hygienic wipes, medicine and bags for trash and toilet emergencies.
Driving around the city has become more dangerous during the blackouts; road traffic accidents are up 25%, according to police. Shops shut down when they lose power and some restaurants have begun to advertise ¡°blackout¡± menus of food and beverages they can serve during cuts. Workers come out to the street and smoke when a blackout results in an unexpected break.
To help people heat their homes, the Ukrainian government has launched a new online firewood store that makes it easier for people to find local suppliers. Pictures of people trying to heat food with candles are circulating on social media.
Earlier this week, Ukraine¡¯s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk advised Ukrainian refugees?not to return home?this winter because the country¡¯s fragile power grid is at risk of becoming completely overwhelmed.
